    "content": "I'm a <strong>unicorn</strong> that means developer + desginer. I started life as a electrican and switched from hardware to software in 2011. I am a pretty fast learner and always interested in learning new technologies. I put my efforts on learning the last trends on Development, and strive to better myself as a developer. I think one of my values is the ability to resolve problems so from the beginning I've been always focused on solving algorithms no matter the languages I used. I like to integrate systems using Gatsbyjs and GraphQL"
